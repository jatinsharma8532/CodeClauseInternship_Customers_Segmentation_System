In this procject, I worked on a real-world e-commerce sales data and segmented its customer base with Python, [scikit-learn library](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html) and [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/plotly-express/). 

The workflow of the project is as follows:

1. Business Case
2. Data Preparation
3. Segmentation with K-means Clustering
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Visualization and Interpretation of the Results
